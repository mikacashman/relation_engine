    title: AraNetv2 domain co-occurrence
    description: A layer of protein domain co-occurrence values from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database.

    title: AraNetv2 high-throughput protein-protein interaction
    description: Log likelihood score. A layer of protein-protein interaction values derived from four high-throughput PPI screening experiments; from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database.

    title: AraNetv2 literature-curated protein-protein interaction
    description: A layer of protein-protein interaction values from literature-curated small- to medium-scale experimental data; from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were calculated to normalize the data for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et al, 2015).

    title: Mentha AT 3702 040319 PPI
    description: Mentha archives evidence collected from different sources and presents these data in a complete and comprehensive way. Data comes from manually curated protein-protein interaction databases that have adhered to the IMEx consortium and assigns to each interaction a reliability score that takes into account all the supporting evidence. https://mentha.uniroma2.it/about.php

    description: GWAS hits ftom a Gene-to-Metaboiltes GWAS. Phenotypes (metabolites) have a unique ID from the Wu 2016 study (doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1006363) and need to be given our own UID for future use.

  - const       : "GO"
    title       : "GO"

    title       : "Knockout"
    description : "GeneA connects to GeneB if the phenotypic effect of knocking out GeneA is similar to the phenotypic effect of knocking out GeneB. Similarity is based on Phenotype Ontology semantic similarity. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-015-0053-y"

    description : "GeneA connects to GeneB if their protein products have been shown to bind to interact with each other, typically through experimental evidence. The PPI-6merged network is the union of 6 different A.thaliana PPI networks: AraNet2 LC, AraNet2 HT, AraPPInet2 0.60, BIOGRID 4.3.194 physical, AtPIN, Mentha. These 6 were all relatively high scoring with GOintersect. DOI: [TODO]"

    title       : "Regulation-ATRM"
    description : "GeneA connects to GeneB if GeneA is a Transcription Factor (TF) that is shown to interact with GeneB (which may or may not be a TF). This dataset contains literature mined and manually curated TF regulatory interactions for A.thaliana. Started from 1701 TFs from PlantTFDB 2.0 and retrieved 4663 TF-associated interactions. These were manually filtered (e.g. FPs, PPI interactions removed). They then added some from other sources. Final result is 1431 confirmed TF regulatory interactions, of which 637 are TF-TF.
